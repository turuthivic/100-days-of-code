# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March, 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Beginning my 100 days of code. 
**Goal,  advance in Ruby and RoR; senior developer.

**Thoughts:** I've worked with RoR seriously for about 1 and 1/2 years now. Never got out of the framework cocoon and the convention over configuration. Time to wake up and do the metal stuff now. Goal, test test test, hard-code SQL, write helper ruby methods and venture into *sinatra* and *himana* frameworks.

**Link to work:** not yet
